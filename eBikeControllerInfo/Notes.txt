The small ebike controller uses an STM32 controller to get things done.
No shock there.

It gets info from the trigger at a logic level of 5 volts,
and sends back responses at a logic level of 3 volts at a high, but unmeasured baud rate,


The large ebike controller uses a self-branded XCM-K microcontroller.
There is no infomration about this controller online,
but it appears to be a generic clone of a SH79F1611U chip.

This chip is made by SINO WEALTH, based on 8051 architecture
